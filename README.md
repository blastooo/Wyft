# Wyft

Do you like using Lyft, the app that's basically your friend with a car? Wouldn't it be cool to meet people and use their wifi in exchange for a (completely optional) gift? Wyft allows you to search for users within a zip code offering to host you and give you access to their wifi. You might just meet your next best friend.
